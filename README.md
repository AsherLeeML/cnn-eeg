## PREREQISITES
- Physionet data from: https://www.physionet.org/pn4/eegmmidb/
- Python 2 environment with:
	- numpy, scipy, matplotlib
	- tensorflow & keras
	- pyedflib (for data input)


## USAGE

The main.ipynb is an iPython notebook representing the entry point. 
I recommend running it in an Anaconda evironment (which also includes numpy/scipy/matplotlib).
Anaconda can be downloaded from: https://www.anaconda.com/download/

The code represents a starting point for data preparation and training the neural network models.
It does not provide methods for plotting/evaluation/visualization.
